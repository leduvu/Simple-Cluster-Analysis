# Simple-Cluster-Analysis
Elbow-method and k-means 2D plotting

The code stays nearly the same, only the filename and the number of given clusters have to be changed to get the following results.

### Data set 1
The first graphic displays the variance for a range of clusters.
Since the variance does not change so much after the cluster number of 5, it is likely that the data is grouped into 5 different 'chunks'.

The second graphic shows, how the k-means implementation using "sklearn.cluster" in python, divides the data.

### Data set 2
Here the kink is at cluster number 2 and the graphics devides the 2 big piles quiet nicely.
